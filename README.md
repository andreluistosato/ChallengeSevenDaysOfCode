# ChallengeSevenDaysOfCode
This is my solution for the 7 days of code proposed by [Alura](https://7daysofcode.io/).


- First day: Get a IMDB api key, make a request to get the top 250 movies and print in the console
- Second day: Get a list of titles, images, ratings and years
- Third day: Create a model class for Movie and map a list of it based on the JSON
- Fourth day: Generate programmatically an HTML page to display the movie list
